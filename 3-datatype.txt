Data types in JS -> In JavaScript, variables hold values, and each value possesses a data type that indicates the nature of the stored information. Broadly, JavaScript classifies data types into two categories: Primitive data types and Non-primitive data types.

[Note : To find datatype of ant variable use typeof function]

1. Primitive data types: The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types. There are 7 type of primitive datatypes

Below is a list of Primitive Data Types with proper descriptions and examples:

A. Numbers -> Number data type in javaScript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.
example -> let x = 250;
    	   let y = 40.5;

B. String -> The string data type in JavaScript represents a sequence of characters that are surrounded by single or double quotes.
example -> let str = 'Hello All';
		   let str1 = "Welcome to my new house";
		   "abc" + 123  // output : "abc123"
		   
C. Undefined -> This means that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, or it has been explicitly set to the value `undefined`.
example -> let x;
		   console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined

D. Boolean -> The boolean data type can accept only two values i.e. true and false.

E. Null -> This data type can hold only one possible value that is null.
example -> let x = null;

F. BigInt -> BigInt data type can represent numbers greater than 253-1 which helps to perform operations on large numbers. The number is specified by writing ‘n’ at the end of the value.
example -> let bigNum = 123422222222222222222222222222222222222n
