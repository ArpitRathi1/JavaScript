Operators -> used to perfrom some opearations on data. Javascript operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations.

1. Arithmetic operators -> +(addtion), -(substraction), *(multiplication), /(divisiom), **(exponentiation), %(modulus), ++(increment by 1), --(decrement by 1)

++x -> pre increment operator -> firstly increment the value secondly use the value
x++ -> post increment operator -> firstly use the value secondly increment the value
--x -> pre decrement operator -> firstly decrement the value secondly use the value
x-- -> post decrement operator -> firstly use the value secondly decrement the value

[Note : Increment and Decrement operator is unary operator which means they only require only one operand to perform operation]

2. Assignment operators -> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator	Example   	Same As
=	        x = y	     x = y
+=	        x += y     x = x + y
-=	        x -= y	   x = x - y
*=	        x *= y	   x = x * y
/=	        x /= y	   x = x / y
%=	        x %= y	   x = x % y
**=	        x **= y	   x = x ** y
