Prototype in Js -> A JS object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and methods)
				   JS object have a special property called prototype.
				   Prototype is also an object which contain special methods and properties.
				   All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
				   we can set prototype using (__proto__)
				   type of prototype -> referance to an object
				   
				   [Note - If object and prototype have same method, object's method will be used.]

Classes in Js -> Class is a program-code template or blueprint to create objects.
				 ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
				 A JavaScript class is not an object.
				 It is a template for JavaScript objects.
				 JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.
				 Use the keyword class to create a class.
				 Always give class name with Pascal notation : First latter capital
				 Always add a method named constructor():

				 Class Syntax : class ClassName {
								  constructor() { ... }
								  method_1() { ... }
  								  method_2() { ... }
 								  method_3() { ... }
								}
				 When you have a class, you can use the class to create objects:
				 syntax : let myObj = new ClassName()

				 constructor method -> The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created.
				 					   
				 					   The constructor method is a special method:
				 					   1. It has to have the exact name "constructor"
				 					   2. It is executed automatically when a new object is created
				 					   3. It is used to initialize object properties
				 					   [Note : If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.]
