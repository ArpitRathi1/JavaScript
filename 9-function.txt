JS functions -> A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
				A function can be invoked whenever needed.
				With functions you can reuse code.
				To avoid code redundency.

Function Syntax -> A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
				   Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
				   The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
				   The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
				   
				   syntax : function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
 				   	 			// code to be executed
				   			}

The () Operator -> The () operator invokes (calls) the function
				   syntax : functionName()

parameter and argument -> varible used in function defination is called parameter.
						  Parameters of a function are like local variables and they have only block scope
						  while the value which we pass during the function call is called argument
