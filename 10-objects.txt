Object -> Object has some properties and methods.
		  Object is collection of key value pairs.
		  Functions inside object is called methods.
		  Object literal -> {}

this -> In an object method, this refers to the object.

Object Constructor Functions -> Sometimes we need to create many objects of the same type.
								To create an object type we use an object constructor function.
								It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter.
								Example - function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
											  this.firstName = first;
											  this.lastName = last;
											  this.age = age;
											  this.eyeColor = eye;
											}
								[Note : In the constructor function, this has no value.
								The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.]	

								const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
								[new - new keyword is used to create a new object]
