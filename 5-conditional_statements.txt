Conditional Statements -> Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
						              You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
A. Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
B. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
C. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
D. Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Syntax -
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}

# Switch Cases -> Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
