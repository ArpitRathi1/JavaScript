String in JS -> are sequence of characters to represent text.
				Stirng are immutable.
Example - 
let text = "John Doe";

You can use single or double quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
Strings created with single or double quotes works the same.
