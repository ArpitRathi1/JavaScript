String in JS -> are sequence of characters to represent text.
				Stirng are immutable.
Example - 
let text = "John Doe";

You can use single or double quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
Strings created with single or double quotes works the same.

# Template Strings -> Templates were introduced with ES6 (JavaScript 2016).
					  Templates are strings enclosed in backticks (`This is a template string`).
					  Templates allow single and double quotes inside a string:
					  let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;
					  [Note : Templates are not supported in Internet Explorer.]
					  Templates allow multiline strings:
				  	  let text =
				      `The quick
				      brown fox
				      jumps over
				      the lazy dog`;
