String in JS -> are sequence of characters to represent text.
				Stirng are immutable.
Example - 
let text = "John Doe";

You can use single or double quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
Strings created with single or double quotes works the same.

# Template Strings -> Templates were introduced with ES6 (JavaScript 2016).
					  Templates are strings enclosed in backticks (`This is a template string`).
					  Templates allow single and double quotes inside a string:
					  let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;
					  [Note : Templates are not supported in Internet Explorer.]
					  Templates allow multiline strings:
				  	  let text =
				      `The quick
				      brown fox
				      jumps over
				      the lazy dog`;

# Escape Characters -> Code	Result
						\b	Backspace
						\f	Form Feed
						\n	New Line
						\r	Carriage Return
						\t	Horizontal Tabulator
						\v	Vertical Tabulator
						[Note : Lenght of escape characters is not 2, it is 1]

# String Length - To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:
				  let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
				  let length = text.length;
				  Templates allow multiline strings:
				  let text =
				  `The quick
				  brown fox
				  jumps over
				  the lazy dog`;

# String indices - To find character at a particular index
