JavaScript Loops -> Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. 
					Loops are used to execute a code again and again.

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

1. for - loops through a block of code a number of times
2. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
3. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
4. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
5. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object

1. for -> 
Syntax-
for (initialization; testing condition; increment/decrement) {
    // block of code 
}

# Infinite Loop -> A loop that never ends.
				   [Note : Never do it in a program]
				   A loop whose stopping condition never returns false
				   
2. JavaScript while Loop->
Syntax-
while (boolean condition) {
    loop statements...
}

3. JavaScript do-while Loop -> The JS do-while loop is similar to the while loop with the only difference is that it checks for the condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of an Exit Control Loop. It executes loop content at least once even the condition is false.
Syntax-
do {
    Statements...
}while (condition);

4. JavaScript for-of Loop -> JS for-of loop is used to iterate the iterable objects for example – array, string. It directly iterate the value of the given iterable object and has more concise syntax than for loop.
Syntax -
for(let variable_name of  object_name) {
    // Statement
}

5. JavaScript for-in Loop -> JS for-in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. The for-in loop iterates only over those keys of an object which have their enumerable property set to “true”.
Syntax -
for(let variable_name in object_name) {
    // Statement
}
