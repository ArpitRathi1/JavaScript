JavaScript Loops -> Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. 
					Loops are used to execute a code again and again.

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

1. for - loops through a block of code a number of times
2. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
3. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
4. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
5. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object

1. for -> 
Syntax-
for (initialization; testing condition; increment/decrement) {
    // block of code 
}

# Infinite Loop -> A loop that never ends.
				   [Note : Never do it in a program]
				   A loop whose stopping condition never returns false
