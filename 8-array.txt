Arrays in JS -> The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.
Array is a collection of items.
Linear ways to store information.
[Note- In JS array is also a special type is object which also contains key-value pair but we use index instead of key.]

# Description : 1. JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. 
				2. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
				3. JavaScript arrays are mutable

# Creating an Array : 
					 Syntax: const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];

# Length property : To find lenght of an array.
            		Syntax : arr.length

# Accessing Array Elements : You access an array element by referring to the index number
							 const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
                         	 let car = cars[0];    // output : saab
                         	 [Note: Array indexes start with 0.]
                         	 [Note: if we try to access a index which is not present in the array it will give undefined as output]

# Looping over an array : using forloop
						  using for-of loop
						  using forEach loop
