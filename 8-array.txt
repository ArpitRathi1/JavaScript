Arrays in JS -> The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.
Array is a collection of items.
Linear ways to store information.
[Note- In JS array is also a special type is object which also contains key-value pair but we use index instead of key.]

# Description : 1. JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. 
				2. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
				3. JavaScript arrays are mutable

# Creating an Array : 
					 Syntax: const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];

# Length property : To find lenght of an array.
            		Syntax : arr.length

# Accessing Array Elements : You access an array element by referring to the index number
							 const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
                         	 let car = cars[0];    // output : saab
                         	 [Note: Array indexes start with 0.]
                         	 [Note: if we try to access a index which is not present in the array it will give undefined as output]

# Looping over an array : using forloop
						  using for-of loop
						  using forEach loop

# Adding new element : push() -> To add element at end
					   syntax : arr.push(element)

					   unshift -> To add element at start
					   syntax : arr.unshift(element)

					   splice() -> To add element at a specific index
					   syntax : arr.splice(index, delete-count, element)

# Removing element : pop() -> To remove last element
					 syntax : arr.pop()

					 shift() -> To remove first element
					 syntax : arr.shift()

					 splice() -> To remove element at specific index
					 syntax : arr.splice(index, no. of elements you want to remove)

# Searching : indexOf() -> To find index of a perticular element
			  syntax : arr.indexOf(element, from which index you want to start searching)
			  [Note : it will return -1 if element is not present in array]

			  includes() -> return true if element present in array else false
			  syntax : arr.includes(element)

# Emptying an array : There are two ways to empty an array.
					  1. by length
					  syntax : arr.length = 0
					  2. by splice 
					  syntax : arr.splice(0,arr.length)

# Joining array : join() -> To convert an array into string
				  Join does not change the original array, it return a new string
				  syntax : arr.join("")
